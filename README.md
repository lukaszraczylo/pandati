## Pandati

Your little Golang helpers toolkit

### Purpose of the project

Keeping things DRY for your projects. Set of most popular and frequently used helper functions making it easier to focus on the 
logic you want to implement rather than re-inventing the wheel ( and spending precious time going through StackOverflow ).

### Name of the project

It's one of the sweet names I use to call my wife. She's always full of ideas and able to help with absolutely everything.
